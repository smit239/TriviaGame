# TriviaGame


This game I will create a trivia form with true/false options.
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

The game ends when the time runs out or all questions are answered. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
The player can pick one answer per question.

The game will include a countdown timer.
